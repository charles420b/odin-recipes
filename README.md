This project will cover the basics of making a website using HTML.
During this the coder will have demonstrated that he has, albeit elementary, the knowledge to create one himself.

This ReadMe will serve as an assessment to oneself after the project has been completed.

The following could be used as a criteria to evaluate the said project:
    * Has the coder followed the lesson enough to merit him of good work?
    * Could the code have been improved more but not as much as to deviate from the lesson?
    * Has the coder applied in this project the lessons he learned prior? (e.g using git to document the project)?
