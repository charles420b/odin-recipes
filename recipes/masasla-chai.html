<h1>Masala Chai</h1>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon loose leaf black tea</li>
    <li>2 cardamom pods</li>
    <li>1 clove</li>
    <li>1 inch knob of ginger, chopped into slices</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon of black peppercorn, freshly cracked</li>
    <li>1/2 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon sugar, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Add the whole spices to a mortar and crush them lightly into smaller pieces.</li>
    <li>In a small saucepan on high heat, pour in the water and add the spices.<br>
        Bring the water to a boil and add the tea bags or leaves. Lower the heat to a<br>
        medium to low setting and simmer for two minutes, or until the tea leaves<br>
        and spices have released flavor and color. Then, pour in the milk.</li>
    <li>Pull Chai.<br>
        Use a small cup with a handle or ladle to scoop some of the chai<br>
        and "pull" it while itâ€™s simmering. Start by pouring in the chai at a low height<br>
        and steadily move up higher while continuing to pour the chai back into the<br>
        pot to create bubbles. Repeat a few times until the chai is bubbly.</li>
</ol>
